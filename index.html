        <b>
    <p class="Muller">Both Derek Muller and Carol Dweck embrace the part of learning that eradicates the fear of failure and looking stupid. Specifically, Carol Dweck cites multiple research studies over various groups of people that find a significant difference between people with fixed and growth mindsets. She states that individuals with fixed mindsets are reluctant to change and fear that they might look unintelligent in front of others. In other words, people with fixed mindsets fear failure and avoid it at all costs. Similarly, Derek Muller shares his philosophy behind learning and that looking foolish is the key to learning. He makes a note that being unknowledgeable is not the same as being unintelligent and suggests that not knowing information does not mean one is incapable of learning it. </p>

            <h2 class="header1">Suggestions for Learning Environments</h2>
            <p class="me">As Carol Dweck mentions, the key to one’s ability to learn is in one’s mindset. For this reason, it is best to teach in an environment that does not punish failure but, rather, celebrates it. This does not look like many of the current school settings students where the material is taught quickly and expected to be retained in a short amount of time. Rather, learning is a process and is not something that occurs overnight. It involves repetition and persistent struggles with ideas or problems. Like any other muscle in the body, the brain requires time to grow and expand, and people must be willing to put in the work and allow it the time to do so.</p></b>
